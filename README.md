##Features: 
The main idea is to display full year (from december year-1 to January year+1) on one page, to provide quick access to months and days.  
So many months and days as desired can be opened at the same time and texts can be dragAndDroped.  
Simple calendar if you aren't logged in, it becomes an agenda/schedule by logging.  
A text can be associated with a day of the month and/or the entire month.  

Layout and behaviour may be different according to screen size or browser ratio.

##Recommendations :
This app is designed to run on a valid HTML5 browser. 

Tested on :  

- recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers 
- IE mobile v10 - Smartphone Htc 8S
- IOS Safari - Ipad
- Android: native & Firefox browsers - Htc smartphone and Acer tablet.  
- Firefox-OS - simulator.
- standalone app from Firefox-Marketplace - Android mobiles and Windows PC.  

It is the HTML5 version of a Flash web-app : [www.flash-line.org/app/web/calendar/](http://www.flash-line.org/app/web/calendar/)  
Flash version only works on desktop computers.   
You can use currently both versions because they target the same database.   

Orientation "portrait" is better on smartphones and tablets.  
On a large width tablet in landscape-mode, the layout is the same as PC/Mac. But the portrait-mode seems still preferable to me.  

I use this calendar myself and backup all data.  
But if you want to do it yourself, it is better to download and install the application on your web server.

English is not my mother language as you can see... As Droopy says, I'd be an happy taxpayer...  
if a real english speaking corrects:  

- [application's texts](https://github.com/flashline/FL-Calendar/blob/master/bin/custom/en/language.xml) or  
- [documentation](https://github.com/flashline/FL-Calendar/blob/master/bin/doc/help.en.html)
